# Extreme Temperatures Dataset
## Overview
The Extreme Temperatures dataset provides information on temperature extremes experienced in various countries. 
It records instances of extreme cold, moderate cold, moderate heat, and extreme heat for different countries and years. 
This dataset can be useful for climate studies, environmental research, and understanding the impacts of temperature extremes on different regions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes several records, each representing the temperature extremes for a specific country in a given year. Here's a description of each column:

1. country: The name of the country.
2. Code: The ISO code of the country.
3. Year: The year in which the temperature data was recorded.
4. Extreme cold: Instances of extreme cold recorded for the country in the given year.
5. Moderate cold: Instances of moderate cold recorded for the country in the given year.
6. Moderate heat: Instances of moderate heat recorded for the country in the given year.
7. Extreme heat: Instances of extreme heat recorded for the country in the given year.

## Learning Outcomes
From this dataset, we know this dataset is unsupervised learning, beacuse it doesn't have any clear target column.
so we can only grouping the columns and find something useful so this unsupervised learning

## Dataset Source
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
